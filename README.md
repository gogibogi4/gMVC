gMVC is a simple PHP MVC oriented framework.

It allows you to create an API or a server side rendered webpage.

Since this is a work in progress some features are not yet implemented and the structure might change at any time. Feature ideas and improvements are also welcome.

<h1>How to use</h1>

To use gMVC you need to modify Router.php. A response can be generated by using ViewResponse or JSONResponse. It is also possible to create a custom response type by extending Response.

The project also includes some examples.
